Mucklucks will satisfy your travel planning, reminiscing, and curiosity needs.  
The site has a private world map where you can mark the places you've been. Users have the ability to add their own photos/blogs/advice to each country.  This information is then added to a public map, where users can read through travel advice from other globe-trotters.
